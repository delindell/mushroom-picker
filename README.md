# Mushroom Picker

## Description

The following application was our first introduction into the React framework, and all of the exciting things that go along with it. An entirely component based app where the user randomly selects a mushroom from the forest that gets added to their basket randomly. Some mushrooms are poisonious, deadly, or magic, resulting in different outcomes for the user. Some interesting logic was created to make these random outcomes occur with different consequences or rewards.

This project taught us how to use JSX, classes, React Components, state and props along with many of the other amazing things React offers. It is amazing how much quicker you can create and deploy a project using this framework versus using plain old vanilla JS. It's awesome!
